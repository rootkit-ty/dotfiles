1. Intro                                                        *aws-vim-intro*

Overview of plugin

2. Requirements                                          *aws-vim-requirements*

Plugins that might help to write Cloud Formation Templates (not necccessary
needed for this plugin to work) :
     
    * elzr/vim-json for json colouring and also showing wrongly formated code
    * jiangmiao/auto-pairs for auto-pairing brackets, braces etc
    * SirVer/ultisnips for snippets usage

===============================================================================
3. Configuration                                        *aws-vim-configuration*

There are two major configuration parameters that you could add to your vimrc file:

* put **let g:AWSVimValidate = 1** to have a prototype of document validation whenever you try 
    to write the document. The same functionality you can map with a **call AWSValidate()** function
* if you use the **ultisnips** pugin you can add a folder *snips* from aws-vim folder to the variable 
    **g:UltiSnipsSnippetDirectories** for example:  
        let g:UltiSnipsSnippetDirectories=["UltiSnips", "./bundle/aws-vim/snips"]
  In order to get the snippets completion (it works when no " sign is in line and the completoin occurs on first element on that line)
  If the snippets are connected to my snippets, please add the following line to your .vimrc file in order to get i t work:
    let g:AWSSnips = "Alarm Authentication Base64 CreationPolicy FindInMap GetAtt Init Instance InstanceProfile Join LaunchConfiguration LoadBalancer Param Policy RDSIngress Ref Role SGEgress SGIngress ScalingPolicy ScheduledAction SecurityGroup Select Stack Subnet VPC Volume VolumeAttachment WaitCondition WaitConditionHandle asg cft init_command init_file init_group init_user"
    
==============================================================================
4. Usage                                                        *aws-vim-usage*

Plugin register files with extension **template** as files of type **"aws.json"**. 
It is done that way, because the plugin itself doesn't expose the syntax colouring functionality.
If you use any plugin for json colouring then it will work with the Cloud Formation Template files.

By default plugin uses vim user completion, so you can execute completion by simply use the combination
**<Ctrl+x><Ctrl+u>** in insert mode. 

If issued completion on blank line list of snippets will show up ( for example
: cft - a template document with basic structure will pop up automatically  )

**IMPORTANT** 
The plugin works only when the document is well formed. If there are some bugs in the document, the plugin may 
not work at all or show incorect completions. Before posting an error please validate the json structure of your 
document.
