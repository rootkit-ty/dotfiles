# Rootkitty's Dotfiles

Welcome to the repository of my dot files, and configuration files.

## Notes

- These should be system-linked on a new system, and I will deploy a script to do this at some point.
- They should also be compatible between OSX and Linux.
- These dotfiles are whitelisted, to avoid me accidentally uploading something sensitive. So you'll need to add an exclusion in the gitignore
