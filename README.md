# Rootkitty's Dotfiles

Welcome to the repository of my dot files, and configuration files.

## Screenshots

Pictures are worth a thousand words

### Vim on linux

## Notes

- These should be system-linked on a new system, and I will deploy a script to do this at some point.
- They should also be compatible between OSX and Linux.
- These dotfiles are whitelisted, to avoid me accidentally uploading something sensitive. So you'll need to add an exclusion in the gitignore

## Find append script

What exactly is `find_append.sh` script, and what does it do?

Put simply it's a script that will automatically add exceptions to the blacklist recursively.

## Script to syslink?

There is currently no script to link all the files to your home directory from the git repo.

While this is planned, it's some time off.
